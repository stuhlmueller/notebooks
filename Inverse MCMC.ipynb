      "In the following, $x$ denotes the ERP variables, $y$ denotes the auxiliary \"higher-level\" variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are given $p(x)$, $q(y)$, and $q(x|y)$.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using inverses for importance sampling requires us to additionally specify $p(y|x)$. This choice affects our estimates, and I couldn't find a canonical, easily computable choice for it.\n",

      "This motivates looking into MCMC as an alternative sampling mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the following, we assume that $q(x|y)$ is deterministic.\n"
